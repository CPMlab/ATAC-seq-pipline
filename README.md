# **ATAC-seq Snakemake Pipeline**

## **Overview**
This repository contains an **automated ATAC-seq analysis pipeline** built using **Snakemake**. The pipeline is designed for efficient and reproducible processing of **Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)** data. It follows a structured workflow to **process raw FASTQ files, align reads, perform quality control, call peaks, and compare different peak calling methods**.

The pipeline allows for the **benchmarking of peak calling tools** by systematically comparing their outputs, including **peak overlap analysis and Jaccard similarity calculations**. This ensures that the most suitable peak caller can be selected for specific datasets.

### **Key Features**
- Fully automated workflow using **Snakemake**.
- Supports multiple peak calling methods (**MACS2, HMMRATAC, Genrich, SEACR**).
- Implements **quality control** at multiple stages, including **read filtering and duplicate removal**.
- Provides **comparison and benchmarking** of different peak calling tools to assess performance.
- Generates **bigWig tracks** for visualization.
- Configurable through a **config.yaml** file.

---

## **Pipeline Workflow**
The pipeline consists of the following major steps:

1. **Pre-processing and Quality Control**
   - Initial sequence quality assessment using **FastQC**.
   - Adapter trimming and quality filtering using **fastp**.
   - Reference genome indexing using **BWA**.

2. **Read Alignment and Post-processing**
   - Aligning reads to the reference genome using **BWA**.
   - Sorting and indexing BAM files using **samtools**.
   - Removing low-quality reads and duplicate reads using **Picard MarkDuplicates**.
   - Removing mitochondrial and blacklisted reads using **bedtools**.

3. **Peak Calling and Benchmarking**
   - Running multiple peak calling tools: **MACS2, HMMRATAC, Genrich, and SEACR**.
   - Computing **Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP) Score**.
   - Computing **Jaccard similarity between peak sets**.
   - **Comparing the performance of peak callers through overlap analysis**.

4. **Signal Track Generation**
   - Generating **bigWig tracks** for visualization using **deepTools bamCoverage**.

5. **Comparison of Peak Callers**
   - Evaluating **peak overlaps** between different peak calling tools.
   - Calculating **Jaccard similarity scores** to assess the similarity of peak sets.
   - Counting the **total number of peaks called by each tool**.

## **Detailed Explanation of Each Step**


### **1. Pre-alignment QC**
- Adapter trimming using `fastp` to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases.
- Quality control assessment using `FastQC` to inspect sequence quality.
- Indexing the reference genome using `BWA index`.

Independent replicates should be processed separately.

#### **Initial QC Report**

The raw sequence data should first be assessed for quality. [FastQC reports](https://dnacore.missouri.edu/PDF/FastQC_Manual.pdf) can be generated for all samples to assess sequence quality, GC content, duplication rates, length distribution, K-mer content, and adapter contamination. In ATAC-seq data, it is likely that Nextera sequencing adapters will be over-represented. As described by [Yan et al. (2020)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-020-1929-3), base quality should be high although it may drop slightly at the 3' end, while GC content and read length should be consistent with expected values. For paired-end reads, run FastQC on both files, with the results output to the current directory:

```bash
fastqc <sample>_R1.fastq.gz -d . -o .
fastqc <sample>_R2.fastq.gz -d . -o .
```

#### **Adapter Trimming**

Adapters and low-quality reads/bases should be trimmed using one of several programs, such as [trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic), [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Adapter contamination can be seen in the FastQC report.

For this pipeline, fastp is used to remove adapter sequences.

```bash
fastp -i <sample>_R1.fastq.gz -I <sample>_R2.fastq.gz -o <sample>_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -O <sample>_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz --detect_adapter_for_pe -j <sample>.fastp.json -h <sample>.fastp.html
```

### **Reference Genome Indexing**
Before aligning reads, the reference genome must be indexed:
```bash
bwa index reference.fa
```

### **2. Read Alignment and Post-processing**
- Aligning reads using `BWA`.
- Sorting and indexing BAM files using `samtools`.
- Marking and removing duplicate reads using `Picard MarkDuplicates`.
- Filtering out low-quality reads and blacklisted regions using `bedtools`.

```bash
bwa mem -t 8 reference.fa trimmed_R1.fastq.gz trimmed_R2.fastq.gz | samtools sort -o sample.sorted.bam
picard MarkDuplicates I=sample.sorted.bam O=sample.dedup.bam M=metrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true
```

### **3. Peak Calling and Benchmarking**
The pipeline runs multiple peak calling tools and compares their performance.


#### MACS2 (Standard ATAC-seq Peak Caller)
```bash
macs2 callpeak -t sample.filtered.bam -f BAMPE -g hs -n sample --outdir peaks/
```

#### HMMRATAC (Specialized ATAC-seq Peak Caller)
```bash
HMMRATAC -b sample.filtered.bam -i sample.filtered.bam.bai -g genome.info -o sample
```

#### Genrich (Optimized for Removing Duplicates)
```bash
Genrich -t sample.filtered.bam -o sample_peaks.narrowPeak
```

#### SEACR (Sparse Enrichment Peak Caller)
```bash
bash SEACR.sh sample.filtered.bam peaks/
```

## **4. Benchmarking and Comparison of Peak Callers**
To evaluate and benchmark peak calling methods, the pipeline performs the following analyses:

### **Peak Overlap Analysis**
Identifying peaks that are called by multiple tools:
```bash
bedtools intersect -a macs2_peaks.narrowPeak -b hmmratac_peaks.narrowPeak > macs2_vs_hmmratac.bed
```

### **Jaccard Similarity Calculation**
Quantifying the similarity between peak sets:
```bash
bedtools jaccard -a macs2_peaks.narrowPeak -b genrich_peaks.narrowPeak
```

### **Counting the Number of Peaks Detected**
Checking how many peaks are detected by each tool:
```bash
wc -l peaks/*.narrowPeak
```

## **Signal Track Generation**
Generating signal tracks for visualization:
```bash
bamCoverage --binSize 10 --normalizeUsing BPM --bam sample.filtered.bam -o sample.bw
```
